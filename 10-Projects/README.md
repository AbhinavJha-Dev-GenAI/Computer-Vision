# 10. Computer Vision Projects 💻

Apply your knowledge by building these end-to-end projects. Ranging from Beginner to Advanced levels.

## 🥇 Beginner Level
1. **Virtual Paint Application**: Use hand tracking (MediaPipe) to draw on the screen in real-time.
2. **Document Scanner**: Use OpenCV (Contours + Perspective Transform) to scan receipts and auto-crop them.
3. **Face-based Attendance System**: Simple face identification (DeepFace) with CSV data logging.

## 🥈 Intermediate Level
1. **Social Distancing Monitor**: Use YOLOv8 to detect people and calculate Euclidean distance between them.
2. **License Plate Recognition (ANPR)**: Combine Object Detection (Plate) and OCR (Characters).
3. **Yoga Pose Corrector**: Use Pose Estimation to compare a user's pose against a "perfect" reference pose.

## 🥉 Advanced Level
1. **Real-time PPE Detection**: Custom training YOLOv8 to detect Helmets, Vests, and Gloves in construction sites.
2. **Autonomous Driving Simulation**: Use Lane Detection and Semantic Segmentation to keep a car in its lane.
3. **Medical Image Segmentation**: Use U-Net to segment tumors from MRI scans.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Use `cv2.VideoCapture` or download from Kaggle/Roboflow.
2. **Labeling**: Use **CVAT** or **LabelImg** for bounding boxes/masks.
3. **Training**: Use PyTorch or Ultralytics for training.
4. **Optimization**: Convert to **TensorRT** or **OpenVINO** for faster inference.
5. **Deployment**: Build a UI using **Streamlit** or a Mobile App using Flutter.

> [!TIP]
> Always document your projects on GitHub with a clear Demo Video or GIF! Visual proof is everything in Computer Vision.
